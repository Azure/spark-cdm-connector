# spark-cdm-connector

A preview release of a connector that allows Spark dataframes to read and write entities in a CDM folder.  For more information and a list of known issues see the provisional user guide in the documentation folder.  Currently only tested with Azure Databricks.

The library available here is in an early limited preview and is not recommended or supported for use in production applications.
